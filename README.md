Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a robust object detection model for identifying road sign boards in the Gilgit region using YOLOv5. This application can help enhance road safety and navigation by detecting signs with high accuracy.

Dataset
The dataset consists of annotated images of road sign boards specific to the Gilgit area. Each image is labeled with bounding boxes for four different classes of road signs.

Classes:

[List of classes here]
The dataset is split into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance.

Installation
To set up the environment for training and evaluation, follow these steps:

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install YOLOv5 dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # Clone YOLOv5 repo
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
Model Training
The YOLOv5 model is fine-tuned on the Gilgit road sign board dataset. Training parameters include:

Epochs: [e.g., 50]
Batch size: [e.g., 16]
Image size: [e.g., 640x640]
Run the following command to start training:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data custom_data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on a validation set. Key evaluation metrics include:

mAP (Mean Average Precision): Measures the accuracy of the model in detecting each class.
Precision and Recall: Indicators of the model's accuracy and sensitivity.
Results
The final model achieved the following performance:

mAP: [Insert mAP value here]
Precision: [Insert precision value here]
Recall: [Insert recall value here]
Sample results are visualized in the notebook to demonstrate the modelâ€™s predictions on test images.
